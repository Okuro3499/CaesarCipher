# Caesar Cipher

## Description
This is a cipher application which encrypts messages by shifting letters in the message a certain number of places also known as a key, down the alphabet.

## BDD
Plain:    ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
Cipher:   XYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVW

First, make sure it can translate really basic, single-character words
 "A" should come out as "Z"

Once that's working, move onto multiple-character words
"THE" should come out as "QEB"

When you have that, move onto full sentences.
Plaintext: "THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG"
Ciphertext: "QEB NRFZH YOLTK CLU GRJMP LSBO QEB IXWV ALD"
